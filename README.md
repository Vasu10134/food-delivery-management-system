- MySQL for database management

## Setup Instructions:
1. Create a MySQL database and tables by running `create_database.sql`.
2. Configure your MySQL connection details in the `DatabaseHelper.java` file.
3. Run `FoodDeliverySystem.java` to interact with the system.

## How to Run:
1. Compile all Java files.
2. Run `FoodDeliverySystem.java` to simulate the food delivery system.
